# Logger by Salesforce Labs

Logger is a cross-platform (iOS/Android) mobile app to log sales activities and notes. Logger is a [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) hyrbrid app build on top of the [Salesforce Mobile SDK](http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Mobile_SDK) for [iOS](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS) and [Android](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android).

Install the app for [iOS](http://bit.ly/LoggeriOS) or. [Android](http://bit.ly/LoggerAndroid).  
Follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/saleslogger).

## Setup

In order to build Logger you need [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) version >=0.8 and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org). All other dependencies are install with NPM:

    $ sudo npm install -g coffee-script
    $ git clone git@github.com:ForceDotComLabs/Logger.git
    $ cd Logger
    $ npm install .

To test Logger as a NodeJS web app you also need [Redis](http://redis.io/) and [node-dev](https://github.com/fgnass/node-dev).

    $ brew install redis
    $ sudo npm install -g node-dev


## OAuth
### Hybrid App
Create a new Connected App:
- Setup
- App Setup -> Create -> Apps
- Connected Apps -> New
- Enter all required information
- Specify `loggr:///login/success/redirect` as the __Callback URL__.

If you want a different Callback URL you can edit `src/coffeescript/ContainerAuth.coffee`. It is best practice to not include the Consumer Key in the source code. Therefor you have to declare an environment variable. If you use bash edit your ``/.bash_profile` and export the Client Id:

    export LOGGER_CLIENT_ID=<Your OAuth Consumer Consumer Key>

### Web App
To run the web app you need to create another OAuth consumer with the Callback Url `http://localhost:4000/token` and also export the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret:

    export LOGGER_WEB_CONSUMER_KEY=<Your OAuth Consumer Consumer Key>
    export LOGGER_WEB_CONSUMER_SECRET=<Your OAuth Consumer Consumer Secret>
The variables are used in `routes/index.coffee`.

## Build Targets

To build the hybrid app open the terminal and call `make` with the corresponding target. The process adds watchers to the filesystem which re-compiles CoffeeScript, Stylus and the templates whenever a change is detected.

### iOS

    $ make ios

Open `xcode/Logger.xcodeproj` with XCode. Select your device or the simulator and run it with `Cmd+r`. Whenever you change source code you only have to re-run the app again to see the changes. When you are done developing kill the `make ios` process.

### Android

__Fetch all the related git project dependencies__
    
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

__Import projects into Eclipse__
- Go to File -> Import and select General -> Existing Projects into Workspace.
- Import the `<logger_dir>/android/external/SalesforceMobileSDK/native/SalesforceSDK` project from [Salesforce Mobile SDK Android](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android)
- Similarly, select the folder `<logger_dir>/android` and import project `Logger` into the workspace.

__Build and run__

    $ make android
Right-click Logger in the Project Explorer and select _Debug As_ -> _Android Application_.

Whenever you change source code you only have to switch to Eclipse, select the project, hit F5 and re-run the app. When you are done developing kill the `make android` process.

__Hint__

If you see error `Unable to resolve target 'android-15'` make sure you've got Android 4.0.3 (API 15) installed via the SDK manager.

### NodeJS Web App
To test the web app you need to run Redis and NodeJS express server:

    $ redis-server & make nodejs

Open browser and point to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and login with your Salesforce credentials. To enable cross-domain request we recommend to use [Google Chrome Canary](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs/) and disable the web security with the following script:


    #!/bin/bash
    open -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome\ Canary.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security

Chrome Canary also supports to emulate a mobile browser with Touch events and specific device metrics like 320x480.

__IMPORTANT__: Only use this browser instance for testing since web security is disabled!

## Development

All source files live in the `src` directory.

### Scripting

Scripting is implemented using [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org).  
The main entrypoint is `src/coffeescripts/Main.coffee`.

### Styling

Styling is implemented using [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/).  
`src/stylesheets/main.styl` contains the main stylesheets and `src/stylesheets/mixins.styl` contains the mixin-functions.

### Templates

[Hogan.js](http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/) is used as the template engine.  
The main site templates are in `src/views` and all others are in `src/templates`.

### NodeJS

For the NodeJS portion please have a look at `app.coffee` and `routes/index.coffee`.

## Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are build on top of [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js).

    $ make tdd

## Notifications

Verve notifies whenever a file has been recompiled or tests are passing/failing whenever a file is changed.

For [Growl notifications support](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-growl) install growlnotify.  
On OS X 10.8, Notification Center is supported using terminal-notifier. To install:

    $ sudo gem install terminal-notifier

### Functional Tests

The [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) tests are still experimental and work in progress.

    $ brew install casperjs
    $ make casper

In order to run the tests you need to specify environment variables for the test user:

    export LOGGER_TEST_USER=<test user username>
    export LOGGER_TEST_PASS=<test user password>

The tests run a headless browser and take screenshots which can be found in the `temp` directory.

## Lint

CoffeeLint is used as CoffeeScript linting engine.  
Config file: `test/config/coffeelint.coffee`  
Run it with:

    $ make lint

Right now you see lots of errors for `Line ends with trailing whitespace`. This is caused by the way we document the code using docco and there is an [enhancement request file](https://github.com/clutchski/coffeelint/issues/45).

## Docs

Docs are generated using [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/) and [Pygments](http://pygments.org).

    sudo easy_install Pygments
    make docs

Open the docs folder and find the source code documentation for each class.
